          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Ayurveda - A science for inner growth. Our approach to Ayurveda is going to the roots of its science where the
            basic idea is to prepare a ground for spiritual growth. We would say Ayurveda is the Art of living life with
            harmony and healthy function of the body and mind. Only when this harmony is attained there is space for the
            soul to grow and a chance to attain harmony with cosmos. According Ayurveda there are five cosmic forces in nature:
            Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether. Certain combinations of them make three forces called Dosha: Vatta, Pitta,
            Kapha. Each of them resides in the body and has certain responsibilities, controlling physical and mental functions.
            The proportions of the Dosha are different to everyone and this is the bodyâ€™s true nature and creates our individuality.
            <br>
            <br> When we live according to mind and society and not according to our true nature, when we intake toxins and breath
            polluted air, or have emotional traumas, the proportions of the Dosha easily alters and we get physical and mentally
            ill. But if the mind is tuned with our nature and the body is pure, we live in the state of harmony called health
            which is the growing ground for the seed of our souls. Now meditation can happen.
            <br>
            <br> Ancient sages of India developed techniques and processes in certain combinations with herbs and massage, which
            help to rebalance the life forces and nature's elements within us to obtain this harmonious state.
            <br>
            <br> One such process is called Panchkarma, consisting of five major procedures in a certain sequence during 21 or
            28 days, which together makes a powerful deep cleansing, healing and rebalancing effect.
            <br>
            <br> "Tantra, Yoga, Ayurveda, all the old physiologies, their work was revealed and made known through inner meditative
            techniques."
