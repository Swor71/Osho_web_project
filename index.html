        <p>“For seekers on the path, the essential wealth is the life energy. To reach the energy peak, we need meditation techniques
          and also important devices to support our journey, like ayurvedic therapies for purification and balancing, massage
          for stimulation and healing, adventures for provoking our energy and courage, and astrology to understand our own
          potentiality. It's like an embrace, caring of all dimensions and the whole, only then we can celebrate life"

          <h2>Swami Prem Keerti</h2>
          <p>My life made a turn at young age when listening to Osho, and the words “live dangerously!” hit me so deeply to
            set out on a life journey full of adventures, in both the outer and inner world. Since then, living dangerously
            and living with totality is the key to explore myself. That’s how I decided to become an Osho sannyasin and just
            after graduation I left my native village in Rajasthan and a waiting career as a scientist and engineer, with
            a thirst to instead dive deeper into the world of inner sciences.</p>

          <h2>About Ayurveda</h2>
          <p>Ayurveda - A science for inner growth. Our approach to Ayurveda is going to the roots of its science where the
            basic idea is to prepare a ground for spiritual growth. We would say Ayurveda is the Art of living life with
            harmony and healthy function of the body and mind. Only when this harmony is attained there is space for the
            soul to grow and a chance to attain harmony with cosmos. According Ayurveda there are five cosmic forces in nature:
            Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether. Certain combinations of them make three forces called Dosha: Vatta, Pitta,
            Kapha. Each of them resides in the body and has certain responsibilities, controlling physical and mental functions.
            The proportions of the Dosha are different to everyone and this is the body’s true nature and creates our individuality.
