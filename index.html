        <p>“For seekers on the path, the essential wealth is the life energy. To reach the energy peak, we need meditation techniques
          and also important devices to support our journey, like ayurvedic therapies for purification and balancing, massage
          for stimulation and healing, adventures for provoking our energy and courage, and astrology to understand our own
          potentiality. It's like an embrace, caring of all dimensions and the whole, only then we can celebrate life"

          <h2>Swami Prem Keerti</h2>
          <p>My life made a turn at young age when listening to Osho, and the words “live dangerously!” hit me so deeply to
            set out on a life journey full of adventures, in both the outer and inner world. Since then, living dangerously
            and living with totality is the key to explore myself. That’s how I decided to become an Osho sannyasin and just
            after graduation I left my native village in Rajasthan and a waiting career as a scientist and engineer, with
            a thirst to instead dive deeper into the world of inner sciences.</p>

          <h2>About Ayurveda</h2>
          <p>Ayurveda - A science for inner growth. Our approach to Ayurveda is going to the roots of its science where the
            basic idea is to prepare a ground for spiritual growth. We would say Ayurveda is the Art of living life with
            harmony and healthy function of the body and mind. Only when this harmony is attained there is space for the
            soul to grow and a chance to attain harmony with cosmos. According Ayurveda there are five cosmic forces in nature:
            Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether. Certain combinations of them make three forces called Dosha: Vatta, Pitta,
            Kapha. Each of them resides in the body and has certain responsibilities, controlling physical and mental functions.
            The proportions of the Dosha are different to everyone and this is the body’s true nature and creates our individuality.

          <p>If we are on the journey of becoming conscious, Health is not something that we address once we are sick, it is
            an every day act. Of what we eat, how we sit, how we walk, what we think. Keerti has designed a series of simple
            workshops that can give the participants an insight into their body-minds according to the ancient ayurvedic
            wisdom...

          <p>Secrets of the pulse analysis have been thoroughly kept in the East — in India, Tibet and China. For generations,
            this knowledge has been circulating in narrow circles.
            <br>
            <br>With the help of VedaPulse™, the art of pulse analysis became available to a wide range of specialists.</p>

          <h2>About Bio-well</h2>
          <p>Our focus on adventure is about the inner exploration, the biggest adventure that can ever happen in our life.
            It is on this adventure we’ll need the most courage, more than any outer adventure will ever demand. But through
            the outer adventures, we can gain courage to face the inner one and we can provoke our life energy which is the
            most important resource on our journey towards meditation.</p>

          <h2>Massage</h2>
          <p>Receiving massage is an important part of a seekers journey. In a combination with meditation techniques, it gives
            a great support to your growth process. It helps to make the body purified, the life energy flowing and your
            whole system more tuned. Then you can more easily tune with nature and existence, and flow with the river of
            life.
