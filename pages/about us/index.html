          <h2>Swami Prem Keerti</h2>
          <p>My life changed at a young age while listening to Osho. His words “Live dangerously!” hit me deep, I set out on
            a journey full of adventures, in both the outer and inner world. Since then living dangerously and with totality
            has been the key to exploring myself. That is how I decided to become an Osho sannyasin. Just after graduation
            I left my native village in Rajasthan and a prospective career as a scientist and engineer, with a thirst to
            instead dive deeper into the world of inner sciences.
            <br>
            <br> I wandered around to live with different groups of traditional sannyasins, yogis, ayurvedic healers and astrologers.
            People eager to explore and understand the mystic sciences and knowledge of ancient India and how they are interconnected,
            experiencing intimately their value for seekers.
            <br>
            <br> The ancient sciences were all developed by seers and seekers as a support to meditation and inner exploration
            but the real essence is totally forgotten. I realized that the essence of all sciences is about life energy and
            I recognized that life energy is the real wealth of our inner journey.
            <br>
            <br> During my wanderings I spent much time alone in forests, jungles and deserts, experiencing a close connection
            with nature. During that phase I got a lot of help from the surroundings, in a subtle way. I felt strongly how
            nature is mothering, a deep trust in existence arose in me that has helped me explore the innermost core of my
            being.
            <br>
            <br> Thereafter I lived many years in various Osho meditation centers, devoting myself full time to inner growth
            using Osho's meditation techniques.
            <br>
            <br> I reached Himalaya in 2008 to the newly opened Osho Nisarga Meditation Centre near Dharamsala. For almost five
            years taking care of the meditation hall, participating, learning and training myself continuously in all the
            activities, therapies and meditations being taught there.
            <br>
            <br> Now I live in a small village called Sidhpur, near Dharmsala. There I have opened Osho Ayurveda, a centre for
            massages and treatments where we welcome visitors from all over the world who want to discover the potential
            of Ayurveda as a tool for spiritual seeking.
